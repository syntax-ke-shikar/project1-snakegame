# Snake Game - Syntax ke Shikar

## **Introduction**

This is a **classic Snake Game** implemented in **C++** with support for both **single-player and multiplayer modes**. The game is played on a **30x30 grid**, and the objective is to **eat the fruit** while avoiding collisions with the walls, obstacles, and yourself. In multiplayer mode, two players compete to achieve the highest score.

## **Features**

- **Single-player mode:** Navigate the snake, avoid obstacles, and achieve the highest score.
- **Multiplayer mode:** Two players control separate snakes and compete.
- **Dynamic obstacles:** Random obstacles appear in single-player mode.
- **High Score Tracking:** The game saves the highest score in a file.
- **Smooth Gameplay:** Uses `_kbhit()` for non-blocking input handling.
